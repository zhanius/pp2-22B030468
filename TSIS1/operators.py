a = 5

#Arithmetic operators:
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)
print(a ** b)
print(a // b)

#Assignment operators:
a += 5 # which means a = 5 -> a = a + 5 -> a = 10
print(a)

'''Comparison operators:
are used to compare to operators: == ; <= ; => ; < ; > ;
'''
#Logical operators: to combime conditional statements
# and ; or ; not ;

#bitwise operators:
print(a&b)
print(a|b)
print(a^b)
